I didn't have anywhere specific to put these, but they might conceivably be useful for other people, so I've put the maps below. The [code to make these maps is on Gist](https://gist.github.com/mpjashby/7485de3f8fc0565abf0dfec61b025550).\n\nFeel free to use these maps in any projects -- see the bottom of the page for a link to the Creative Commons Attribution licence.\n\n\n### Central East\n\n![Locator map for the Met Police Central East BCU](https://i.imgur.com/zaHdruH.png)\n\n\n### Central North\n\n![Locator map for the Met Police Central North BCU](https://i.imgur.com/Cn1OYrw.png)\n\n\n### Central South\n\n![Locator map for the Met Police Central South BCU](https://i.imgur.com/3WTVnMy.png)\n\n\n### Central West\n\n![Locator map for the Met Police Central West BCU](https://i.imgur.com/NlvIUfW.png)\n\n\n### East Area\n\n![Locator map for the Met Police East Area BCU](https://i.imgur.com/4738GOW.png)\n\n\n### North Area\n\n![Locator map for the Met Police North Area BCU](https://i.imgur.com/eI5LK7d.png)\n\n\n### North East\n\n![Locator map for the Met Police North East BCU](https://i.imgur.com/yKtkK52.png)\n\n\n### North West\n\n![Locator map for the Met Police North West BCU](https://i.imgur.com/LwIJCCh.png)\n\n\n### South Area\n\n![Locator map for the Met Police South Area BCU](https://i.imgur.com/JJ2hhYH.png)\n\n\n### South East\n\n![Locator map for the Met Police South East BCU](https://i.imgur.com/ptTVfCk.png)\n\n\n### South West\n\n![Locator map for the Met Police South West BCU](https://i.imgur.com/qrx7Xtf.png)\n\n\n### West Area\n\n![Locator map for the Met Police West Area BCU](https://i.imgur.com/F5PB7QU.png)\n",
