However, only about 1.6% of these extra tests catch a drink driver, compared to about 14% of routine tests.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/display plot-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n[larger image](../breath-tests.png)\n| [annotated R code to produce this chart](https://github.com/mpjashby/lesscrime.info/blob/master/content/post/breath-tests.Rmd)\n\nData source: [Home Office, 2019](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/police-powers-and-procedures-england-and-wales-year-ending-31-march-2019)\n\n### Notes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n'Extra' tests associated with the annual Chirstmas crackdown on drink driving were calculated as the mean number of tests conducted in December each year minus the mean number of tests conducted in other months.\n\n\n\n\n\n",
