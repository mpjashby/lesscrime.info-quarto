Child sexual exploitation is a highly sensitive and largely hidden issue that is notoriously difficult to research.

We will discuss approaches we took to mitigate these challenges and to ensure high-quality research outputs. Finally, we will reflect on some more general lessons both for the providers and for the users of non-research-oriented secondary data. Their application, we contend, could help ensure more effective research collaborations in future.\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\nCitation: E Cockbain, M Ashby, H Brayley-Morris. 2016.
