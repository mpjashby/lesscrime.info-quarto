The problem-solving process helps work out what to do, who needs to do it and how to get them involved. This brief guide, drawing on extensive research and experience, aims to go further than most other guides currently held within our individual police forces. It seeks to increase understanding and provide a wider range of techniques to help you become better problem-solvers and consequently better police officers. It will also point you towards further sources of sound advice in relation to specific issues.
